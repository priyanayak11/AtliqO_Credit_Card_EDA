# AtliqO_Credit_Card_EDA
AtliqO Credit Card project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior in a credit card business and identify the most suitable target customer segment for strategic decision-making.

🎯 Business Objective
- To analyze customer demographics and spending behavior in order to:
- Identify high-value customer segments
- Understand patterns in credit usage
- Recommend the ideal target segment for business growth

🧠 Problem Statement

🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- MySQL  
- SQLAlchemy  
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

📂 Dataset Summary
The dataset includes customer-level information such as:
- Age
- Income
- Credit limit
- Spending amount
- Credit usage behavior

🔎 Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Univariate analysis of customer demographics
- Bivariate analysis of income vs spending
- Segment-wise analysis based on age and income groups
- Visual analysis to support business conclusions

📈 Key Insights

🔹 Phase 1: Overall Platform & Category Analysis
- Amazon emerges as the most dominant e-commerce platform across all age groups, with exceptionally strong usage among the 26–48 age segment, indicating high trust and frequent usage among working professionals.
- Flipkart shows strong adoption, particularly within the 26–48 age group, making it the second most preferred platform overall.
- Meesho, Alibaba, Shopify, and eBay demonstrate comparatively lower adoption across all age groups, suggesting limited penetration among mainstream consumers.
- CRED records the lowest overall adoption; however, slightly higher engagement within the 26–48 age group indicates relevance among financially active users.
- The 26–48 age group exhibits the highest purchasing activity across all platforms and categories, identifying it as the most commercially active segment.
- Electronics is the most dominant product category across all age groups, with particularly strong demand from the 26–48 segment, reflecting higher spending capacity and technology adoption.
- Fashion & Apparel ranks as the second most popular category, especially among the 18–25 and 26–48 age groups, highlighting lifestyle-oriented consumption patterns.

🔹 Phase 2: Focus Segment – Age Group 18–25
- Based on Phase 1 findings, the analysis narrows down to the 18–25 age group to better understand emerging consumer behavior and future growth potential.
- The 18–25 segment demonstrates strong engagement in Fashion & Apparel, indicating trend-driven and lifestyle-focused purchasing behavior.
- While overall spending is lower compared to older age groups, this segment shows high platform experimentation and brand sensitivity, making it valuable for long-term customer acquisition.
- Preference for established platforms like Amazon and Flipkart suggests trust in reliable ecosystems, while openness to newer platforms indicates potential for targeted marketing strategies.
- This age group represents a future high-value segment, where early engagement can translate into long-term customer loyalty.

🔮 Next Steps
- Based on the insights derived from exploratory data analysis, the next phase of this project will focus on experiment-driven decision making and predictive analytics.
- A/B testing can be conducted on the 18–25 age group to evaluate the effectiveness of targeted marketing strategies across platforms and product categories. Additionally, predictive modeling can be developed to estimate customer purchase propensity and segment-level value, enabling more personalized and data-driven business decisions.
